# Anki deck's and coding exercises
These shared anki cards I've made for my own learning. 
Anki is an awesome program for studying any material using flashcards using [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition), a study method proven highly effective.

Please visit [AnkiWeb](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to know more about how Anki flashcard revision works.

*Note:* Some of the programming exercises are based on [shared Anki Python deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1060094053)
