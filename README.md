# Anki decks and coding exercises
These shared anki cards I've made for my learning. 
Anki is an awesome program for studying any material using flashcards using [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition), a study method proven highly effective. 

Please visit [AnkiWeb](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to know more about how Anki flashcard revision works. 

**PS:** *Meanwhile, you can also read a wonderful [blog](https://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html) by Michael Nielsen on how to remember almost anything with the Anki system.*

**Note:** Some of the programming exercises are based on [shared Anki Python deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1060094053)
